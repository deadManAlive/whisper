# Whisper
---
~~Personalized~~ localized communication server for ESP32 using Svelte and Arduino framework.
Initially made for Universitas Indonesia 2022/2023 Electrical Engineering's Embedded System-2 class final project.
## ESP32
[ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) is a low-cost MCU that is very rich in features and of course portable.
## Svelte
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a compile time front-end framework (basically just HTML compiler) that outputs responsive UI without relying on vDOM like React or Vue.
## Getting started
